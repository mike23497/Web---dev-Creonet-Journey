Great job finishing the topic on CSS comments, cascading, and inheritance! Here's a set of **two beginner-level CSS tasks** based on **real-world application**, and then **5 fill-in-the-gap questions** to test your understanding.

---

### ✅ **Task 1: Personal Blog Header**

**Objective:** Use comments and inheritance principles to style the blog header section.

#### HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="task1.css">
  <title>My Blog</title>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>My Coding Journey</h1>
    <p>Sharing what I learn daily</p>
  </header>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Requirements for `task1.css`:

* Use a comment at the top of your CSS file to label it as your blog header styling.
* Set a background color for the `header` tag.
* Set a color and font size for the `h1` and `p` elements.
* Apply the font color using inheritance (don't apply it directly to `h1` or `p`).
* Override the inherited font size for only the `p` tag.

### ✅ **Task 2: Product Card Display**

**Objective:** Apply cascade and specificity rules to design a product card.

#### HTML:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="task2.css">
  <title>Product Card</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="card">
    <h2 class="title">Smartwatch</h2>
    <p class="description">Stay connected on the go.</p>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
```

#### Requirements for `task2.css`:

* Use a CSS comment to describe what each block of styles does.
* Set a default font color and background for `.card`.
* Try applying a different font color to `h2` via `.card h2` even though it already inherits a color.
* Set a different background using an ID selector (e.g., if you changed `.card` to have an ID like `id="product"` and style with `#product`).
* Make sure your CSS demonstrates cascading by writing two conflicting styles, then resolving which one applies using specificity.

### 🧠 **5 Fill-in-the-Gap CSS Questions**

> *Fill in the missing word(s) in each sentence.*

1. A CSS comment starts with /* and ends with */.
2. Inheritance passes styles from a parent element to its child element.
3. The principle of the browser default styling determines which CSS rule wins when multiple rules target the same element.
4. Inline styles have element specificity than external or internal stylesheets.
5. The `color` property is often inherited by text-based elements like header element and div element or section element.

Excellent work finishing the tasks! Let’s **evaluate everything step-by-step**: your HTML, CSS, and the fill-in-the-gap questions — with feedback, corrections, and explanations to **help you grow professionally**.

## ✅ **TASK 1: Blog Header Styling**

### 🔍 Review of HTML & CSS:

**Your HTML**: ✔️ Looks great and well-structured.

**Your CSS**:

```css
/*This is a comment for the header tag*/
header {
    background-color: lightblue;
    color: rgb(2, 27, 48); /* Inherited by h1 and p — good! */
    font-size: 20px;
}
p {
    font-size: 15px; /* Overrides inherited font size — correct */
}
```

### 🧠 Feedback:

* ✅ You correctly **used inheritance** for color.
* ✅ You **overrode font-size** for `<p>`, showing understanding of cascading and inheritance.
* ✅ You used a **clear comment**.
* ✅ You didn’t hard-code styles into `h1`, which is good.

### ⭐ Grade: **9.5/10**

Only small typo in HTML: `jouerney` → should be `journey`.

## ✅ **TASK 2: Product Card Display**

### 🔍 Review of HTML:

```html
<div class="Card"> ... </div>
```

❗ `class="Card"` is capitalized. In HTML, **class and id names are case-sensitive**, so `.Card` ≠ `.card`. But your CSS used `.Card`, so it still works, but **not a best practice**. Use lowercase for consistency (`class="card"` and `.card` in CSS).

### 🔍 Review of CSS:

```css
/* default font color and background */
.Card {
    background-color: lightgray;
    color: burlywood; /* inherited by all text */
}

/* background override using ID selector */
#Card {
    background-color: lightblue; /* higher specificity */
}

/* h2 color via cascade override */
.Card h2 {
    color: blueviolet;
}

/* conflicting style — .title wins due to specificity */
.title {
    font-size: 30px;
    color: darkblue;
}
```

### 🧠 Feedback:

* ✅ Nice use of **comment blocks** to explain intent.
* ✅ Demonstrated **cascade**: `.title` color overrides `.Card h2` due to equal specificity + last rule.
* ✅ You included **inheritance** for text color.
* ✅ You showed **ID > class specificity** via `#Card`.

### Suggested Fixes:

* 🔠 Prefer `class="card"` (lowercase) in HTML and CSS for consistency.
* ⚠️ You assumed ID was used (`#Card`) but didn't actually apply it in the HTML. So this style **won’t apply**.

✅ If you want the ID to apply, change:

```html
<div id="Card" class="Card">
```

### ⭐ Grade: **8.5/10**

Great effort, but a small disconnect between your CSS and HTML.

## ✅ Fill-in-the-Gap Questions: Corrections & Feedback

1. ✅ Correct!

   * **Your Answer:** `/* and */`
   * ✔️ Perfect.

2. ✅ Correct!

   * **Your Answer:** `parent element to its child element`
   * ✔️ Good understanding of inheritance.

3. ❌ Incorrect.

   * **Your Answer:** `browser default styling`
   * 🔄 **Correct Answer:** `specificity`
   * 💡 Explanation: Specificity determines which rule applies when multiple rules target the same element, not browser defaults.

4. ❌ Incorrect.

   * **Your Answer:** `element specificity`
   * 🔄 **Correct Answer:** `higher specificity`
   * 💡 Inline styles always have **the highest specificity**, overriding external and internal styles.

5. ❌ Partially Incorrect.

   * **Your Answer:** `header element and div element or section element`
   * 🔄 **Correct Answer:** `h1 and p` (or other **text-based elements** like span, a)
   * 💡 Elements like `div` or `section` don't inherit `color` unless they contain text or inherit styles from text-based children.

### ⭐ Grade: **2.5/5**

You understand the basics, but let's improve specificity and inheritance theory.
